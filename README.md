# SCADA System for Hybrid Power Management — Nini Hospital
This project is a SCADA system simulation for a hybrid power system at Nini Hospital. It demonstrates real-time monitoring, control, and visualization of a system integrating solar panels, generators, and batteries.

**Features**
  Real-time monitoring of system parameters
  Basic interface components: buttons, sliders, combo boxes, checkboxes, labels
  Advanced interface components: alarms/events, multi-tag viewer, trends, templates, charts
  Multi-language support
  SQL server integration for data storage
  API data exchange and notifications via email/WhatsApp
  User authentication with multiple profiles
  Exportable reports and CSV data from trends/history
  Rule-based automation and adjustable simulation scenarios

**Project Overview**
This SCADA project was designed to bring a hybrid power system simulation closer to real-world application, optimizing performance while keeping the system structured and easy to manage. All system values are simulated, and scenarios can be adjusted using recipes and service scripts.

**Usage**
  Open the project in ADISRA SCADA software.
  Run the simulation to monitor system parameters in real-time.
  Explore interface features, charts, alarms, notifications, and user profiles.
  Adjust scenarios using the recipe functionality as needed.

**Notes**
This repository is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating SCADA system design and industrial automation concepts.
